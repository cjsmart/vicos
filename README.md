Validated Inequality-Constrained ODE Solver
=============

VICOS is a new validated solver for ODEs with a set of inequality constrains.
It uses [Boost](http://www.boost.org/) for vector and matrix 
arithmetic. We also plan to use 
[VNODE](http://www.cas.mcmaster.ca/~nedialk/Software/VNODE/doc/webpage/install.htm) 
library as a last step validated solver.
